The `.icon` is applied to a `<span>` element and can be a citizen within prose
text or can be put into a flexbox layout. Therefore it has a height of `1em` to
match the height of its neighbouring elements/texts. The span itself is an
inline-flexbox and aligns its items center. That is when the icon is used in a
flexbox layout, the actual icon is positioned appropriately.

The `svg` element inside then receives the sizing for the _actual_ icon itself.
